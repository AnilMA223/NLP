He also attempts to state he can not comment due to past litigation which is also a lie, he reverts to this reply so as to avoid detailing any supposed attempt at resolution which he can not as there is none. Further, he should be aware of resolution which is to refund fees totaling {$610.00} and has not done so, no refund received to date. Please see complaint below. The below complaint was submitted prior, a duplicate form response received from XXXX XXXX with Wells Fargo, one of several. Based on this, my complaint was not addressed. Further, a reply in XXXX was never received as was mentioned. XXXX replied by stating numerous attempts at resolution have been made but has not detailed one, there was no contact from anyone at Wells Fargo aside from XXXX XXXX whom offered a bogus settlement offer. Wells Fargo failed to honor this settlement offer made to me in XXXX by XXXX XXXX, a rep with Wells Fargo. The offer amount, {$3700.00}, was never received and it is now XXXX. Prior to this, I requested a refund in the amount of {$610.00} which includes mainly overdraft fees charged to accounts not authorized. A total of four mediation request forms were sent in, XXXX XXXX contacted me, offered settlement amount in XXXX, no payment received to date.. Since no payment was received in re, additional CFPB complaints were filed. XXXX replied most recently stating numerous attempts at resolution were made, which is a lie and seems to provide the same general form response to each and every complaint. I can assure the CPFB there were no such attempts and Wells Fargo is fully aware of resolution which has been detailed numerous times. I will reiterate again here, refund of {$610.00} will resolve matter since no settlement payment was received. I have contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney as per instructions from a XXXX, a rep with class counsel for Wells Fargo Settlement. XXXX informed me Wells Fargo is involved in at least three class actions, XXXX Settlement, WF Settlement, also a settlement with all 50 states, the Attorney General of each state.. I have also contacted Attorney General here in Connecticut as well as California, advised them of my situation. I suspect XXXX will provide the same carbon copy reply in which case I can assure any third party Wells Fargo claims of attempts at resolution are 100 % false and bogus, he has not detailed one such attempt. Most recently as of, XX/XX/30, I spoke with XXXX XXXX in their Executive Office, she could not find any cases under my name despite numerous CFPB complaints filed as well as OCC, ( Office Of Comptroller Currency ). It appears Wells Fargo has not looked into this matter, evident in the fact they have not opened any cases in re.

            "Complaint: b'My husband and I visited XXXX for vacation from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. We have no family, friends, nor business connections in the country - we were simply there to visit a new place and experience a new culture. Except for one elegant XXXX XXXX XXXX   dinner ( {$200.00} USD ) and a cash advance to take out Euros ( {$250.00} USD ), all of our purchases were below {$70.00} USD. \\n\\nOn our final day in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, we were eating lunch at a restaurant and I planned to pay with my Chase Sapphire card. The waiter said there was a problem with the wireless internet and took my Chase Sapphire card inside the restaurant ( we were seated outside on the patio ). He was in possession of my Chase Sapphire care for approximately 10 minutes outside of my supervision. He returned and claimed the internet was down and said we could pay in USD or go get Euros from a specific ATM that he directed us to in the back of a neighboring store. I opted to go to the ATM and get Euros in order to pay for our lunch because we were worried we would get scammed on the exchange rate he would try and offer us if we paid in USD. \\n\\nAfter resolving the issue at the restaurant and returning home within the next couple of days, I noticed a fraudulent charge for {$5500.00} on my Chase Sapphire card and another attempted charge for about the same amount that was declined by Chase. The statement showed that the fraudulent charge was made at XXXX XXXX, and after some research online I found this to be a marble gravestone/tomb manufacturing business. The charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX, it posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I noticed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately called Chase to dispute the charge. My mind immediately jumped to the situation with the restaurant ( see above ) when the card was out of my possession for about 10 minutes and I was directed to use a specific ATM. I relayed these same facts during my dispute claim and answered all questions and provided all details they asked for, and then I waited to hear back from Chase with a resolution. In addition to disputing the fraudulent charge with Chase, I also tracked down an email for the vendor where the fraudulent charge was made, XXXX XXXX, and emailed them on multiple occasions ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) to explain the situation and request a refund for the fraudulent charge. I also submitted the same inquiry and request on the \" messages \\'\\' portion of their website on XX/XX/XXXX. I haven\\'t heard any response from the business as of XX/XX/XXXX. Due to their lack of response, I also left a negative, public review of the business on XXXX explaining their lack of response to my inquiries about the fraudulent charge in hopes of deterring any potential REAL customers of using their services in the future. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a letter from Chase saying that my fraud claim had been denied because they deemed that I had received a benefit from the fraudulent charge. I immediately started the appeal process by calling Chase. After waiting on hold for 3 hours, I was told to send an email with my credit card number and full name to XXXX in order to file an appeal. Despite my security concerns of sending my credit card number via email, I felt I had no other options and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX with my name and credit card number and requested to start the appeal process. I also requested the following information : a copy of the receipt of this fraudulent charge ( {$5500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), a copy of the receipts of all other charges made on XX/XX/XXXX on this account and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), and a copy of the report that includes a. ) all information that I provided to Chase about this fraudulent charge and b. ) an explanation of exactly why it was denied and deemed that I received a benefit. \\n\\nAfter not hearing back from Chase, I sent another email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my appeal request had been received and to request a phone call or email to confirm that it had been received and let me know that the appeal was in process. \\n\\nI received a phone call from Chase \\'s fraud dispute review department on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that my appeal request had been received. The representative who I talked with told me that he believed my claim was indeed fraudulent and relayed that he didn\\'t believe the fraud department looked at the claim closely enough. He said that they never requested a receipt from the vendor ( XXXX XXXX ) to compare the signature with other receipts on file and he also shared that there were two successive charges in two  different counties in XXXX that they didn\\'t take into account when reviewing it because I couldn\\'t possibly be in two places at once. I also continued to request to see the receipt for the fraudulent charge, receipts for all other charges on XX/XX/XXXX, and the report that detailed the denial of the fraudulent claim. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Chase refuses to send me this information about my fraudulent charge claim, and I believe I have a right to see this as a Chase customer. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my appeal of my fraudulent charge dispute had been denied, meaning that Chase is holding me responsible to pay the {$5500.00} fraudulent charge.

In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program.

The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don\\'t understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn\\'t qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I\\'ve been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven\\'t been able to \" qualify \\'\\' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.'\n",

            "b'Hi, If i am writing today, is to bring to your attention something that happened between myself and XXXX dealership of XXXX XXXX FL. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, date of my end of lease experience, i headed out to the XXXX dealership of XXXX XXXX to return my vehicle and try to negotiate to buy or lease another vehicle. \\nAs soon as i walked in with my wife, we have been introduced to the salesman and the sales manager of this dealership. We then started to negotiate the return of our leased vehicle and asked the team there to please help us getting an interesting deal on another vehicle and explaining our difficult credit situation of my wife and myself. \\nThe leased car we were returning had a that time about {$2800.00} dollar amount of excess millage on the lease terms, and we were assured by the sales manager that by purchasing a new XXXX that day at the dealership that we will be able to negotiate that bill with the financial department of the company later on. Also, when you return a lease, you must pay a excess wear and use of the car but can be waived that fee again by purchasing a new vehicle. \\nAfter a couple of hours of negotiation and a lot of persuasion from the sales team who promised us a lot of benefits, we ended up returning the lease and purchasing a brand new XXXX vehicle. \\nDue to our bad credit history, we got a the new car financed with an APR of 8.39 %. \\n\\nA couple days following our purchase, me and my wife got very surprised about 2 things. \\n\\nFirst of all, as we both checked our credit on XXXX XXXX, we realized that the dealership submitted a lot of credit check to our accounts, not even telling us that will happen. This really affected both our credit history and score. Knowing our credit situation at the dealership, i really do believe that we got kind of scammed that time. \\n\\nSecond, after receiving the end of lease bill by mail, i have contacted the financial department like i was instructed by the sales manager at the dealership in order to discuss it, knowing that he promised me since i have bought a new XXXX vehicle. \\nover the phone with the financial consultant, i was very surprised to hear that nothing was possible, no negotiation on the total amount and no waiver for the excess wear as well, since that apparently we did not get the new car financed with the in-house XXXX financing agency. thing that nor the salesman, or the sales manager told us upon signing the new car purchasing contract. \\n\\ni really need your help in that matter, i really believe we got scammed by the XXXX team, pursuing us to buy a brand new XXXX vehicle in order to get all the benefits that we will never get at the end.'\n",

              "        b'My husband and I visited XXXX for vacation from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. We have no family, friends, nor business connections in the country - we were simply there to visit a new place and experience a new culture. Except for one elegant XXXX XXXX XXXX   dinner ( {$200.00} USD ) and a cash advance to take out Euros ( {$250.00} USD ), all of our purchases were below {$70.00} USD. \\n\\nOn our final day in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, we were eating lunch at a restaurant and I planned to pay with my Chase Sapphire card. The waiter said there was a problem with the wireless internet and took my Chase Sapphire card inside the restaurant ( we were seated outside on the patio ). He was in possession of my Chase Sapphire care for approximately 10 minutes outside of my supervision. He returned and claimed the internet was down and said we could pay in USD or go get Euros from a specific ATM that he directed us to in the back of a neighboring store. I opted to go to the ATM and get Euros in order to pay for our lunch because we were worried we would get scammed on the exchange rate he would try and offer us if we paid in USD. \\n\\nAfter resolving the issue at the restaurant and returning home within the next couple of days, I noticed a fraudulent charge for {$5500.00} on my Chase Sapphire card and another attempted charge for about the same amount that was declined by Chase. The statement showed that the fraudulent charge was made at XXXX XXXX, and after some research online I found this to be a marble gravestone/tomb manufacturing business. The charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX, it posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I noticed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately called Chase to dispute the charge. My mind immediately jumped to the situation with the restaurant ( see above ) when the card was out of my possession for about 10 minutes and I was directed to use a specific ATM. I relayed these same facts during my dispute claim and answered all questions and provided all details they asked for, and then I waited to hear back from Chase with a resolution. In addition to disputing the fraudulent charge with Chase, I also tracked down an email for the vendor where the fraudulent charge was made, XXXX XXXX, and emailed them on multiple occasions ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) to explain the situation and request a refund for the fraudulent charge. I also submitted the same inquiry and request on the \" messages \\'\\' portion of their website on XX/XX/XXXX. I haven\\'t heard any response from the business as of XX/XX/XXXX. Due to their lack of response, I also left a negative, public review of the business on XXXX explaining their lack of response to my inquiries about the fraudulent charge in hopes of deterring any potential REAL customers of using their services in the future. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a letter from Chase saying that my fraud claim had been denied because they deemed that I had received a benefit from the fraudulent charge. I immediately started the appeal process by calling Chase. After waiting on hold for 3 hours, I was told to send an email with my credit card number and full name to XXXX in order to file an appeal. Despite my security concerns of sending my credit card number via email, I felt I had no other options and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX with my name and credit card number and requested to start the appeal process. I also requested the following information : a copy of the receipt of this fraudulent charge ( {$5500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), a copy of the receipts of all other charges made on XX/XX/XXXX on this account and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), and a copy of the report that includes a. ) all information that I provided to Chase about this fraudulent charge and b. ) an explanation of exactly why it was denied and deemed that I received a benefit. \\n\\nAfter not hearing back from Chase, I sent another email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my appeal request had been received and to request a phone call or email to confirm that it had been received and let me know that the appeal was in process. \\n\\nI received a phone call from Chase \\'s fraud dispute review department on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that my appeal request had been received. The representative who I talked with told me that he believed my claim was indeed fraudulent and relayed that he didn\\'t believe the fraud department looked at the claim closely enough. He said that they never requested a receipt from the vendor ( XXXX XXXX ) to compare the signature with other receipts on file and he also shared that there were two successive charges in two  different counties in XXXX that they didn\\'t take into account when reviewing it because I couldn\\'t possibly be in two places at once. I also continued to request to see the receipt for the fraudulent charge, receipts for all other charges on XX/XX/XXXX, and the report that detailed the denial of the fraudulent claim. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Chase refuses to send me this information about my fraudulent charge claim, and I believe I have a right to see this as a Chase customer. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my appeal of my fraudulent charge dispute had been denied, meaning that Chase is holding me responsible to pay the {$5500.00} fraudulent charge.
